Its an easy step.

1. Go to your Obsidian directory. Go to Open Terminal
2. Type cmd first.
3. Type git add . (yes there's space and then there is a dot)
4. Type git commit -m "name the change" (this will be displayed in action tab of mine)
5. Type git push 

You will see all of this in your GitHub action repository tab and you will enjoy it.
